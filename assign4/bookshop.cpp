/*
 A book shop maintains the inventory of books that are being sold at the shop. The list includes details such as author_name, title, price. publisher, and stock position.If customer wants to purchase a book he gives details of book along with the number of copies required. If requested copies are available the total cost of requested copies is displayed; otherwise the message "Required copies not in stock" is displayed. Design a system using a class called Bookshop with suitable member functions and constructor. (Use new operator to allocateÂ memory)
